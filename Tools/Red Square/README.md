# Red Squares

Red Squares are a simple method for measuring spacing when laying out UIs.

## To Use

Import the squares with the resolution that matches the assets youâ€™re using (128px, 256px, etc.). Put those squares into your design to visually check that your sizing and spacing are correct without having to actually measure.
